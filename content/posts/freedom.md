When we’re young, it feels like we will be that way forever. 

Like we will laugh hard with our friends half drunk in bars, pulling our glasses off of sticky counters, scrutinizing over Uber prices to get home, while trying to gauge whether our friends _also_ want to get fries to dull the hangover we will wake up with the next day. 

It feels like forever that we will be able to send a spontaneous text saying “want to go to a cafe and hang out all day? or walk around? or shop? or come over and do nothing?" 

It feels like forever that we’ll be able to get that same text and say yes to it.

It feels like forever that we will have the freedom to do what we want in the present, with the seemingly unurgent voice occasionally nagging at us, wondering if we’re headed exactly where we want to go… 

The truth is when you're young, it feels like you’ll be young forever. Like you’ll have options and freedom and plenty of future ahead, forever. This is true even for the intellectual ones, the self aware ones, the ones who “think ahead”. There is no way to possibly comprehend the process of getting older, of releasing a small part of your potential each day. And yet it is happening. _Without our consent, time is going by._

Each day is one small tick on our life’s clock, the hand moving steadily, consistently, patiently but persistently around the circle. 

It feels like forever that we will have the ability to decide what it is we want to do — _really do_ — not the thing we’re doing that we kind-of-maybe-like, but “aren’t  sure if we'd do this forever”. 

It feels like forever that we will be able to ponder, to wonder, to remain undecided. 

But it isn’t. 

There isn’t any day you have to decide by. No teacher that’s going to email you to say you’re behind or you’re going to fail if you don’t do this work. No parent over your shoulder telling you to do it so you can support your family one day. 

There is no one. No one but you that can determine the trajectory of your own life. The True Trajectory: where to go when you’re listening to _you_, and no one else. 

No one will give you a deadline or a road map or an outline of how to figure out the Assignment of your own life. Only you can do that; only you can harness the discipline, the urgency, and the drive to really figure out what it is that you want. Only you can be truly honest with yourself. 

Only you can look at that hand ticking and decide when to  ramp things up — when to start being you, embracing the parts of you that you often dull to "fit in" or "stay on the right path."

And hey, being honest with ourselves isn't easy. No one tells us how to do it. In fact, we're taught more so how to be dishonest with ourselves, how to look away from our Truth, from the person we really want to be, from the things we really want to do, in order to fulfill some societal vision of who we think we _should_ be. We are trained to look at ourselves through the eys of others. To always seek approval, validation, claps and nods that we are on the right path, that we're doing "the Right Thing." 

So, yeah, untangling the stream of decisions we've made in search of approval is tough! It's complicated. It requires deep thought and introspection, because the things we really want to do, determining and following our True Trajectory, is buried so deeply inside us, under layers and layers of approval-seeking tissue that we've built up to numb ourselves from this part of ourselves. Isn't that bizarre? How confronting it is to get in touch with and access the truest versions of ourselves? That we're more comfortable being who society wants us to be than who we really are?

It is genuinely astounding to think about how much personal responsibility we need to take to actually live the life we want. It never ceases to amaze me how hard I have to work to figure out what it is that I am doing to get the approval of others, to pursue what I've been told to value, vs. what I value, as an individual. Even thinking of one act we have done purely for ourselves, that ahs been purely self directed, can be a challenge. 

I often think about this excerpt from one of my favourite articles of all time [_19 Great Truths My Grandmother Told Me on Her 80th Birthday_](https://www.marcandangel.com/2022/01/18/19-great-truths-my-grandmother-told-me-on-her-90th-birthday/):

Most people live their whole life on default settings! While at first glance this sounds surprising, it also makes complete sense. Society isn't designed to have everyone think independently - it would break! So it's essential to remove any expectation of the world encouraging you to do this work. If you're lucky, maybe there's a person or two in your life that sees something special in you, and has encouraged to follow your own path, to trust in your gifts. But many don't even have this. The only thing we all have - for certain - is ourselves. It's the only thing we can rely on, and the only tool we can activate, any time we want. 


But it is the most important thinking we can do. Because youth isn't forever. This period consisting of little (external) responsibility (no family, kids, mortgages yet)and the opportunity for tremendous personal agency is dwindling, with each passing tick of our clock. 

There is no better time to begin being honest with ourselves than today. And finding that nugget of truth inside us - getting a window into who really are - will take time, effort, discipline, _pain_, even. But it will be worth it, because what greater success is there than living a life that is true to you?
