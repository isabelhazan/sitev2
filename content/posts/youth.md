## seize freedom when it's most accessible to you

When we’re young, it feels like we will be that way forever. 

It feels like forever that we will be laughing hard with our friends half drunk in bars, pulling glasses off of sticky counters, scrutinizing over Uber prices, gauging whether our friends _also_ want to get fries to dull the hangover we will wake up with the next day. 

It feels like forever that we will be able to send a spontaneous text saying _“want to go to a café and hang out all day? or come over and do nothing?"_

It feels like forever that we will have the freedom to do what we want in the present, with the seemingly unurgent voice occasionally nagging at us, wondering if we’re headed where we genuinely want to go… 

The truth is that when we're young, youth feels like it will go on forever. Like we will have options and freedom and plenty of future ahead, forever. This is true even for the intellectual ones among us, the self aware ones, the ones who “think ahead”. One thing that seems consistent at any age is that processing the passage of time feels incomprehensible. There is no way to completely understand or anticipate the process of getting older, of releasing a small part of your potential each day. And yet it is happening. Without our consent, time is going by.

So, instead of trying to "figure out" time, perhaps we should focus on seizing the present. On doing what we want to do "one day", today.

Each day is one small tick on our life’s clock, the hand moving steadily, consistently, patiently but persistently around the circle. 

It feels like we will have forever to decide what it is that we _really want to do_ — not the thing we kind-of-like, but “aren’t sure if it's the thing we'd do forever”. 

It feels like forever that we will be able to ponder, to wonder, to remain undecided. 

But it isn't forever. 

There isn’t any day that you have to decide by. No teacher that’s going to email you to say you’re going to fail if you don’t do this work. No parent over your shoulder telling you to do it so you can support your family one day. 

There is no one. No one but you that can determine the trajectory of your own life. The True Trajectory: what you would do if you were listening to only _you_, and no one else. 

No one will give you a deadline or a road map or an outline for how to figure out the Assignment of your own life. Only you can do that; only you can harness the discipline, the urgency, and the drive to really figure out what it is that you want. Only you can be truly honest with yourself. 

Only you can look at that hand ticking and decide when to ramp things up — when to start really being you, embracing the parts of you that you often dull to "fit in" or "stay on the right path."

And hey, being honest with ourselves isn't easy. No one tells us how to do it. In fact, we're  taught quite early how to be dishonest with ourselves, how to look away from our Truth, to ignore the thought of the person we really want to be, to numb ourselves from the pull we feel to the things we are genuinely drawn to, in order to fulfill some societal vision of who we _should_ be. We are trained to look at ourselves through the eyes of others. To always seek approval, validation, claps and nods that we are on the right path, that we're doing the Right Thing.

So, yeah, untangling the stream of decisions we make in search of approval is tough! It's complicated. It requires deep thought and introspection, because the self knowledge needed to determine and follow our True Trajectory is buried so deeply inside us, under layers and layers of approval-seeking tissue that we literally need to **mine our own mind**, day in and day out, to access it. 

It's incredibly confronting to tap into the true versions of ourselves. The version of ourselves that exists in absence of the desire to please others. We're more comfortable being who society wants us to be than who we really are. We know ourselves better in the eyes of the external world (always acutely aware of how our actions will be 'perceived'), than we know ourselves from an internal perspective (what do _we think_ of who we're becoming? Is this the person we really want to be? Do we even know what that looks like?).

The amount of personal responsibility we need to take to actually live the life that we want is tremendous. It never ceases to amaze me how hard I have to work to figure out what it is that I am doing to get the approval of others, pursuing what I've been told to value, vs. what I am doing that stems from me, from what I value, from what I want, as an individual. Even distilling one act that is purely self directed (done completely for ourselves and no one else) can be a challenge. 

I often think about this excerpt from one of my favourite articles of all time, [_19 Great Truths My Grandmother Told Me on Her 80th Birthday_](https://www.marcandangel.com/2022/01/18/19-great-truths-my-grandmother-told-me-on-her-90th-birthday/):

>**There are thousands of people who live their entire lives on the default settings, never realizing they can customize everything.** 
– Don’t settle for the default settings in life. Find your loves, your talents, your passions, and embrace them. Don’t hide behind other people’s decisions. Don’t let others tell you what you want. Design YOUR journey every step of the way! The life you create from doing something that moves you is far better than the life you get from sitting around wishing you were doing it.</br>

Society isn't designed to have everyone think independently - it would break! So it's essential to remove any expectation of the world encouraging you to do the inner work of discovering a path that is true to you. If you're lucky, maybe there's a person or two in your life who see something special in you, and have encouraged you to follow your own path, to trust in your gifts. But many don't even have this. The only thing we all have - for certain - is ourselves. It's the one constant in our lives that we can rely on, and the only tool that we can decide to activate, any time we want. 

Sorting out our own truth is some of the most important work we can do on a personal level. It is essential to figure out what the North Star of our lives is (who we want to become), so we can work towards this aim, and be confident that the choices we are making align with _where we want to go_.  The thing about chasing approval is that our desire for it is insatiable. There will always be another reward to chase, someone else's approval to gain, another step on the ladder to climb. 

Re-orienting our choices around gaining our own _personal_ approval allows us to focus on independently derived priorities, instead of constantly looking around to see what is "in" right now, what the approval game of the moment is. 

We need to know where we're aiming, because otherwise, [we have no chance of getting there](https://www.isabelhazan.com/posts/alignment/). Society is working over-time to reduce the critical thought we dedicate to our path. Always dangling another reward in front of us to distract us from the inner work of discovering who we are in the absence of the societal gaze we're so used to posing for. 

A thought I've been pondering lately is: _Would my 5 years ago self be proud of where I am now? Of the decisions I'm making today? Am I making decisions in the present that would make my future self proud, grateful, better off?_

Thinking of my choices in terms of past and future versions of myself illuminates one thing pretty clearly: the way to make my past/future self the most proud at any point in time is usually to do the thing that feels the most scary, uncomfortable, and _true_ in that moment. The thing I want to do, but am scared to do. The thing others would caution me against, but what I know within myself I am capable of. 

It's easier said than done to live this principle, but determining what is the most scary and true to us at any given moment, and then doing it, feels like the most we can hope for from ourselves. 

It's worth consistently reflecting on where we are headed to ensure the choices we are making align with us. If we don't, we will continue to follow a trail of rewards, of external validation, of doing the Right Thing, while time relentlessly passes by. 

Youth isn't forever. It is evaporating slowly, like the steam rising from hot puddles after a summer rain. This period consisting of little external responsibility (no family, kids, mortgages yet) and extreme personal agency is dwindling, with each passing tick of our life's clock. 

There is no better time to begin being honest with ourselves than the present. No better time to mine for that nugget of truth within our own mind. No better time to peer into the window inside us to see who really are. Seeking truth takes time, effort, and discipline. It will likely be painful, and disorienting. 

But it will be worth it, because what greater success is there than living a life that is true to you?
