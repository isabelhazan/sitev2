# Who do I write for?
I write for high potential people that want to actualize their potential in a direction that is _true to them_.

## Why do I write?
This site mostly acts as a library of my thoughts. I write to keep myself humble, realize how often I am wrong, and to remind myself how frequently lessons in life repeat themselves until I internalize them. You can read more about me and why I write [here](https://www.isabelhazan.com/about/) 

### Where to find more of me
If you enjoy what you find here, you may want to [sign up for my newsletter](https://isabelhazan.ck.page/) where I send out a weekly(ish) essay outlining my current breakthrough thoughts on life, meaning, alignment, self actualization, and other curiosity-inspired-writing-rabbit-holes.

All of my writing is stored on this site, but you can see some of the original posts on my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@isabelhazan).

I'm also fairly active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/isabelhazan).

If you want to get in touch (I love making new internet friends so don't be shy!), you can say hi on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/isabelhazan) which I check often or email me: hazanisabel @ gmail dot com 

& that's all for now folks! I hope you have fun & learn something new while you're here! If you do, let me know...
