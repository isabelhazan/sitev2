# About Me

A little bit about me.. 


## Structure & Creativity 
- I've always felt a strong pull towards both quantitative and creative pursuits; the times in my life I've felt most aligned and fulfilled is when I've been using both sides of my brain: analyzing, logicizing, building mental structures and mental models that are logically sound & imagining, creating, and expressing myself through art (usually writing). I actually started writing to quench the thirst for creativity I developed while I was studying applied math & mechanical engineering, my imagination being crushed under the weight of seemingly infinite technical courses and no electives. Writing was an oasis for me. A way to keep my creative apetite at bay while I absorbed my technical pursuits with more vigour and mental agility than when I was not being creative.

## Less small talk
- I love conversation. It is one of the most pure and potent forms of joy for me. I adore learning about other people, getting their perspective on things. Intellectual discourse is like the richest, most luxurious, glorious dessert to me. And small talk is the opposite. Mental junk food. Empty calories. While there is a time and a place for it, I like to limit small talk as much as I possibly can. I want to *know* you. Like really know you. And to get to know you, we need to have more to talk about than the weather :). My writing serves this purpose, in part. If you're here, you already know a little bit more about me. This helps me get to know you more quickly, as well! I already know you're willing to stare at a very simple, not at all aesthetically appealing black and white sie just to check out what I might have to say. Awesome. We have starting point. I have some questions to ask you, and you me! Herein lies the beauty of sharing more of ourselves online.. it opens up an entirely new world of friends and relationships which already have more substance and context than plenty of the people I'll meet in person this week -- just by you being here. Welcome :) let me know who you are, so we can connect! Say hi: https://twitter.com/isabelhazan 

## Learning in public
- The writings I share on this humble, simple little site are usually just a relfection of me synthesizing my own thoughts, learnings, and experiences as I go through life. My hope is that they can be helpful to someone else, or crystallize a thought that one of my dear readers might be tip toeing around as well. I am not an expert, and I often change my mind, and update my mental software. I like to keep up as much as my old writing as I can, as I think it is fun to return to, and is also often shockingly reflective of my current learnings. I am always amazed at how many lessons in life repeat themselves over and over, acting as subtle reminders for me to continue writing and integrating the learnings I write about into my life.

## Writing
- Writing has always been a forcing function for me to reflect and stay in touch with myself. The most vivid, present, and heightened times in my life are those that I was writing consistently and actively taking the world in around me. I literally remember the sequence of moments from those periods in my life better. The small things. The sights, the smells, the people I was meeting. The thoughts I was having, the information I was consuming. It's all made more... alive, when I write. The most dull, blurry, and beige times in my life are the ones that I let my writing habit fall off and was passively going through life, failing to internalize all the beauty and significance around me. My hope is that this humble library of thoughts will serve as a vehicle to drive my writing habit forward and always remind me to keep writing. It's simply the easiest way to keep my life colourful. 

## Where to find more of me
All of my writing is stored on this site, but you can see some of the original posts on my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@isabelhazan) , and [sign up for my newsletter](https://isabelhazan.ck.page/) where I sent out a weekly(ish) essay outlining my current breakthrough thoughts on life, meaning, alignment and self actualization - and other experience-inspired-writing-rabbit-holes. 

I'm fairly active on Twitter as well [come say hi!](https://twitter.com/isabelhazan)
