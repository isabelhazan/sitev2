# Hi 
Welcome to my site :) I hope you have fun & maybe even learn something while you're here!

# Where to find more of me
All of my writing is stored on this site, but you can see some of the original posts on my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@isabelhazan) , and [sign up for my newsletter](https://isabelhazan.ck.page/) where I send out a weekly(ish) essay outlining my current breakthrough thoughts on life, meaning, alignment and self actualization - and other life-inspired-writing-rabbit-holes. 

I'm fairly active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/isabelhazan) as well -- come say hi!

And if you'd like to reach out to me directly (I love making new internet friends so do not be shy) - shoot me an email at hazanisabel@gmail.com 

& that's all for now folks!
